# How to use it?

Clone this repository to you computer or browse it online!

If you want to see that implementation, go straight to [Assets/Scripts/](https://bitbucket.org/gaello/unity-webgl-template/src/master/Assets/Scripts/) folder. You will find all code that I wrote to make it work. Code also have comments so it would make a little bit more sense.

I hope you will enjoy it!
